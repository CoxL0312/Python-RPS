# Python-RPS
This is my first Python project. It's a simple rock paper scissors game with a basic AI that chooses a move dependent on just the user's last move. It was also my first attempt doing anything GUI related.

This started as just something in the terminal, but I ended up getting kind of excited and wanted to push myself do try something a bit more, so I followed a few tutorials on YouTube to create this. I want to eventually try a more advanced AI, as I am taking an AI class right now and it seems fun, but we'll see what I can cook before I post anything publically.
